Today, I was interested in finding my most productive songs for running by comparing my running data (from Strava) to my listening data (from Spotify). I decided that I would use pace as a proxy for my productivity.

I learned how to use each platform's API and generated a chart comparing pace to number of plays. My most productive artist for running is Major Lazer!
